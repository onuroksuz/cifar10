Mini Cifar10 Modal
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. There are 6,000 images for each class.
It used in computer algorithms for recognizing objects in photographs. CIFAR-10 is a series of images that may be use to teach a computer how to recognize objects.
Images in CIFAR-10 are low resolution (32x32x3)

In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Network model trained with cifar10 database is designed.
4 convolution layers are used. 
Relu is chosen as the activation function in convolution layers. Softmax is selected as the activation function in the last layer.
A training consisting of 5 epochs was carried out.
RMSprop was chosen as the optimizer and the accuracy was calculated as 0.7296.
